###issues and their estimated points###
1.Create Private Chat Room Feature
Add functionality to allow users to create private chat rooms, and to be able to invite other users on their friend list to join. The messages on the private chat room would not be broadcasted to all users, but instead only to the users in the chat room.  ---300 points

2.Fix Direct Messages
When sending messages to specific users, it is unclear that this is a direct message to the user. Make this clear through a "whisper" system, or some kind of color/text indication.  ---50 points

3.Add Text Color
Assign a random color to the text of a connected client and display their messages in that color. You may want to have a list of pre-determined readable colors to use.  ---150 points
