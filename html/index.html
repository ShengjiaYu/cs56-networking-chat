   <p>This is a client-server chat program. The client and server both have a Swing GUI.</p>
   <p>Note: the JWS seems to have networking problems in CSIL (or maybe Linux in general). Download and run the .jar files to ensure the program functions.</p>
   <p>Basic Usage: The server needs to be started first (including pressing "Start server" on the server GUI window). After starting the server find the IP address of your machine (this address needs to be accessible to the outside world to use the client on another machine). Start the client and input one of the names and passwords from the server window and the IP address of the server then press "Connect to server." Ensure broadcast is selected and type a message into the lower text input box and press enter to send the message.</p>
