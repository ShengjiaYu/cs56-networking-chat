1.Brief Description of project::It's a chat room program that allows P2P (peer to peer) messaging, shows who is online, allows direct contact in between contacts that are online, includes sound effect for a message received, if contact logged on or off ( if sound effect box is checked), enforces login with correct password and Username

1.User Stories::When the server is running, I, as a client, can log into the server so that I can chat with other people online. I can also receive a message from and send a message to other contacts when I am online. Also, as I receive a message, a sound will be played so that I know that I received a message.

...As a server, I can turn on the server for people to chat, shut down the server to terminate chatrooms, and kick clients/contacts out of the server. As a server, I can display the clients/contacts that are online so that I know how many clients/contacts are online and see occurances. As a server, I can display the broadcasts for all clients/contacts so that way everyone will get the message regardless if they're online or not.

1.Does the software run?::Yes or no? If yes, describe it. TBD

1.User stories, what features COULD be added to the software?::We were thinking of implementing font/color features. We were also thinking of Emoji support.

1.README.md_readability?How can this be improve to help the next generation of coders understand?::Maybe it would be nice to include a detailed usage of the application. Have that in a differnt directory. like a mini FAQ or Javadocs. In Features- "Server can kick users" feature is not very clear to what the feature does.

1.Assess the build.xml file, any targets need descriptions? and old legacy JWS to be removed?:: TBD

1.Assess the current issues, are there enough issues that you can earn 1000 points? are the issues' expections clear?:: Yes, there are enough issues to earn 1000 points. TBD

1.list of additional issues added:L TBD

1.assessment of actual code, class purpose? clear methods? relation between classes? code understandability? quick summary of code? TBD

1. Test coverage is comprehensive. There are JUnit testings for ChatClient and ChatServer. The project is covered by everything except for sound test, private room test, sending message to offline contact, and kicking client off server (?). The exceptions to the test coverage could be the opportunities to expand test coverage. We can add the tests to the respective files.
