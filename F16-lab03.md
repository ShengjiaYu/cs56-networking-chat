(a) This project is a client-server based chat program.

(b) As a server I can run Server.jar to make myself available with the IP of the current machine. 
As a user, I can run the Client.jar file to start the client program that enters a chat room hosted at a server with IP:xx.xx.xx.xx which opens a single window interface. I can only login with credentials from a finite list of users currently registered with the server. I can type a chat message to a Broadcast user to send the message to every other user in the chat server, or I can select a single user to send a private message to. All messages are displayed in a single window and play a sound when sent.

(c) The software does run. The chat server must be running before the chat client can connect to it. If the client connects with the wrong credentials, an error is displayed.

(d)As a user, I should be able to register with the server with new login credentials that I want. I should then be able to join *instances* of chat rooms that have other users in them. I should be able to list all the chatrooms I am a member of and switch between them. I should also have the ability to alter the output of my messages (e.g. font, color, emoji's etc.) There should be user rights in specific chatrooms (i.e. admins of chat rooms with the ability to ban users, add users, change user nicknames, promote users, etc.)

As a server, I should be able to see all active chatrooms as well as all active users that update in realtime. I should be able to ban users without deleting their credentials. I should be able to see user privileges for specific chatrooms. I should also be able to specify the relevant networking information (i.e. port # of the chat server).

(e) The current README.md could be altered to have a more extensive view of the java classes included in the src directory.

(f) 

(g)Yes, the sum of the points of all the unclosed issues is higher than 1000 points. And these issues has clear expections.
